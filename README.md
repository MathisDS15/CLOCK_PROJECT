# Clock Project

This project is an interactive graphical clock built using Python and the `tkinter` library. It allows users to view an analog clock, adjust the time manually, and enable automatic time progression.

## Features

- **Analog Clock Display**: A graphical representation of a clock with hour and minute hands.
- **Manual Time Adjustment**:
  - Add 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 30 minutes to the current time.
  - Reset the clock to a specific time (9:37 by default).
- **Automatic Mode**: The clock advances automatically in real-time.
- **Interactive Center Adjustment**: Click anywhere on the canvas to reposition the clock's center.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `tkinter` library (included with most Python installations).
